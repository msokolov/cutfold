* Test funny interior/exterior cuts when folds are involved
* OK Major bug
Still have a problem if we allow cuts to end in the interior - see bug1.txt.
It's pretty clear that when we snap to an edge (is that when selecting?) it can't be the same for every poly since they don't all share the same edges.
** I think the above is fixed (check the script) - but
Now we have a problem sometimes when cuts start and end in the interior but do
in fact intersect a polygon - see bug2.txt
* restructure code
** place model in its own object
will allow for easier undo
** use CFPanel class from Swing version
derive from Panel instead of JPanel?
*** Move Script into CFPanel
* printable folding instructions
** do as i do guideline recording
This is critical for debugging since we can use it to save reproducible cases
* allow fold after unfold
* dissolve creases when possible ?
* make better cursors (esp. for folding and cutting)
not possible in Java 1.1?
* animate cuts/discards?
* choose discards automatically (based on size?)
