<h1>Virtual Paper Cut &amp; Fold </h1>

<p>
Make snowflake patterns, learn how to create a five-pointed star with a
single cut (like Betsy Ross) and more!
</p>

<p>
This app was originally posted in 2002 as flash movie, and then became a
java applet, where it stayed for ten years.  You can still <a
href="applet">try the applet</a>, but we found it was difficult to ensure
that it would work for everyone given the state of Java in the browser and
especially applets in the browser, as browsers continually evolve.  So now
there's an <a href="js/">HTML5/Canvas version</a>.  It doesn't have the
ability to save yet, but I'll probably add that soon.
</p>

<p>
Here are the basic rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  You can <b>fold</b> the paper by (clicking fold and) dragging a line segment
  across it.  Then the cursor will change to an up-down double arrow.
  Click on one side or the other of your fold to indicate which side should
  fold down.

  </li><li>

  You can <b>cut</b> the paper by (clicking cut and) drawing a series of
  connected lines by repeatedly clicking and moving the mouse; the cutting is
  finalized with a <b>double-click</b> (or by crossing your own cutting
  line).

  </li><li>

  You can <b>discard</b> pieces of paper.  Be careful where you click: There
  is only one level of undo.

  </li><li>

  You can <b>unfold</b> - this unfolds the most recent fold.

  </li>
  <li>
    Finally you can <b>save</b> (in the applet version only) by entering a
    name in the type-in box and pressing the "save/print" button. This
    creates several saved versions of your snowflake, including a PDF for
    printability.
  </li>

</ul>

Instructions for our online paper folding activity are below; or you can go
straight to the <a target="_blank" href="applet/gallery/">gallery</a> to see what others
have been up to and start folding paper online yourself!
Or - jump right in and make a flake:

It's not origami, is it, but has many similarities.  We plan to introduce
some additional folding techniques that will enable us to do more
origami-ish stuff.  Take a look at these origami simulations:

Here are the <a href="flaindex.html">original basic rules</a> (for the
flash version).
<ul>
  <li>
  You can fold the paper by (clicking fold and) dragging a line segment
  across it; the line must begin and end outside the bounds of the paper.
  Then the cursor will change to a down arrow.  Click on one side or the
  other of your fold to indicate which side should fold down.

  </li><li>
You can cut the paper by (clicking cut and) drawing a series of connected lines; the cutting happens when you intersect the first line.
  </li><li>
You can recenter the paper if it goes off the screen or gets too small/big.
  </li><li>
You can discard pieces of paper.  be careful - you might discard your work and there is no undo!  (late correction - the Java applet version has one level of undo).
  </li><li>
You can unfold - this unfolds in reverse order of folding.  However - once
you unfold you can no longer fold again (although the program allows you,
this will mangle things strangely).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
When the program has a problem in its topology or geometry, it usually manifests itself as one or more of the following:
<p>
<ol>
  <li> a piece of paper that won't unfold</li>
  <li> a piece of paper that becomes detached from another piece to which it should be attached (by a fold or crease) when unfolded.</li>
  <li> An error message of some sort in a pop up text "trace" window, possibly accompanied by little red and/or blue diamonds drawn on  top of the paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>
